# Pair Programming Schedule

I'll be doing some pair programming sessions on this project.

The sessions are typically 1 hour long, consist of two tomato each (25 minutes each with 5 minutes break in between).

It will involve design, discussion, coding, testing,... everything needed to work on an open source project.

You can join through Visual Studio Code Live Share, and other means for voice communication (I'll need to figure it out).

It will be recorded for study purpose.

I'll post and update the schedule below.
